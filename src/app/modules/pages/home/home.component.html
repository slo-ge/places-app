  <h2>How does MetaMapper work?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      The concept of MetaMapper is very simple. MetaMapper is based on so called "meta tags" which are snippets
      of text or images which are related to a website, i.e. blog posts, websites, or other content. "Meta Tags" are
      hidden for the "normal" users, but they exist in HTML and they are readable for computer programs. The main goal
      of meta tags is to describe your website/product in a way, which is, i.e., relevant for SEO or social sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important tags are the "title" and the "description" tag, and most websites also using the "image"
      tag (og:image), which is commonly used for social media links, which also have a "preview image". Many services,
      i.e. facebook, whatsapp, telegram ..., were using these meta information to show additional information to a
      link which is getting shared. For a more detailed (and technical) description see <a
      href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">HTML meta Tag</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      MetaMapper works in a similar way, it uses these tags to generate a "preview" but also with the
      opportunity to have an image editor, which makes it easy to create an attractive image from any website,
      which can be shared on any social media tool/service in a very simple way.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why using MetaMapper?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      An example: you run a food blog (i.e. wordpress), you were creating content like recipes, restaurants ratings,
      etc. and you also need to share it on facebook, instagram, pinterest (or where ever), you now need to create an
      individual and branded post with an image, an title and so on... so that's the point where MetaMapper is very
      useful. Just insert
      the address of your newly created blog post and let automatically create beautiful preview images which can be
      downloaded on your phone and shared in a rush. This tool also
